## Part 1: Installing
1. Making a project- choose a dir then type "django-admin startproject
{project name.let's use (mysite)}"

2. Making an app- python3 manage.py startapp {name. lets use (polls)}.

adittional: (Making a simple message 'hello world')
1. Go to polls/views.py and type:
from django.http import HttpResponse

def func1(request):
    return HttpResponse('hello world')

2. Make a file urls.py at polls and type:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('helloworld/',views.func1)
]

3. In mysite/urls.py, follow the ff. for URLConf/URL Configuration

## Part 2: Database setting up, creating first model, and a quick intro to
Django’s automatically-generated admin site
1. Database Setup
- Head to the mysite/settings.py and as you notice it is full of module-level
stuffs. 

1.1 Database dictionary- Django has installed database already which is SQLite.
But you can change your db if you want, other db like mySQL, oracle, etc.
As if you notice the DATABASE dict, it contains 2 items:
* ENGINE (depends what backend and db you are using)
* NAME (contains full path (including filename). The default val contains 
BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3' will store that file in project dir)

1.2 Set the TIME_ZONE on your timezone

1.3 INSTALLED_APPS- it has all the app names. It has default apps which is
listed because of the common cases.

1.4 Migrating- to migrate, type 'python3 manage.py migrate'. It creates a 
necessary db tables based on apps present at INSTALLED_APPS and writes
them in your backend/db.

2. Creating Models
Model.py- contains fields(models) and characteristics of your data stored

2.1 Fields(classes)- represented  by every instance inside.
- in our example like the Question field, we have instances;
*question_text- contains models.CharField(maxlength=200), is for character fields
*pub_date- contains models.DateTimeField('date published'), is for datetimes

- On Choices field, we have a ForeignKey() which is to identify relationship
between two fields/classes. Thats why it contains Question class as its
parameter. Its 2nd parameter is 'on_delete = models.CASCADE' means if we 
delete item/s in Question, we also delete its data in Choices

3. Activating Models
3.1 Django apps can be use in different django projects just make sure they
are listed on INSTALLED_APPS at inner django project folder/settings.py.
Just type the dir of apps upto class inside the apps.py.
Format: {dj dir}.apps.{class name} EX: polls.apps.PollsConfig

- After listing it run the code: "python3 manage.py makemigrations polls" to
declare to django that you make some changes on your models (also your database
schema) and you want to save the changes on disk(through migration).

3.2 polls/migrations/0001_initial.py saves the migrations that happened.
They are editable, incase you want to modify something

3.3 command "python3 manage.py sqlmigration polls 0001": takes migration
names and returns their SQL

Note the following:
- The exact output will vary depending on the database you are using. The
example above is generated for PostgreSQL.
- Table names are automatically generated by combining the name of the app
(polls) and the lowercase name of the model – question and choice. (You can override this behavior.)

- Primary keys (IDs) are added automatically. (You can override this, too.)

- By convention, Django appends "_id" to the foreign key field name. (Yes,
you can override this, as well.)

- The foreign key relationship is made explicit by a FOREIGN KEY constraint. Don’t worry about the DEFERRABLE parts; it’s telling PostgreSQL to not enforce the foreign key until the end of the transaction.

- It’s tailored to the database you’re using, so database-specific field
types such as auto_increment (MySQL), serial (PostgreSQL), or integer primary key autoincrement (SQLite) are handled for you automatically. Same goes for the quoting of field names – e.g., using double quotes or single quotes.

- The sqlmigrate command doesn’t actually run the migration on your db - instead,
it prints it to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django
thinks is required. It’s useful for checking what Django is going to do or
if you have database administrators who require SQL scripts for changes.

3.4 python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in your project
without making migrations or touching the database.


3.5 3 steps in making model changes
- Change your models (in models.py).
- 'python manage.py makemigrations' to create migrations for those changes
- 'python manage.py migrate' to apply those changes to the database.

* Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as
you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables
and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without
losing data.

4. Writing and Saving in Database
4.1. Open iPython for manage.py via: python3 manage.py shell.

4.2. Import your models: from main.models import ToDoList,Items.

4.3. Adding data in database is just easy. Lets try adding some data: 
t = ToDoList(name="Michael's Studies"). To save it, simply add: t.save().

4.4. ToDoList.objects.all(): To see all your object, run.

4.5. ToDoList.objects.get(id={object id}): To get a specific data using id.

4.6. ToDoList.objects.get(name='{word}'): to search via name.

4.7. To show its items from relative class:
format: t.{relative class name}_set.all()
ex: t.items_set.all()

4.8. To add items in todolist at t, you must use t.items_set.create(follow the
patterns(give what the instances onto they need)).
Ex: t.items_set.create(text='Finish django',complete=False)

4.9. If you already exit the iPython and you want to access the db inside it,
just import again what we import before to access this db.

5. User Interface (UI)
5.1. The 'URLConf' maps the 'urlpatterns' to views(templates)

5.2. Raising 404- if you enter something that can't be found, the Http404 will
raise automatically. If you want to still type it, just append ff in your
function were you need it:
--from django.http import Http404
-and when you want to use it, specially on if/try statements, just:
--raise Http404("message")

5.3. Removing hardcoded URLs in templates
-Instead of doing this tightly-coupled URLs;
<li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

-Python allows us to do this:
<li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

-As you notice, we use 'detail' instead of URL. It is possible since we
claim it in our urls.py when we add name for detail() and detail.html:

# the 'name' value as called by the {% url %} template tag
path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),

-We already declaire its link in urls.py. The a tag head to urls.py because we
put 'url' inside the value of a tag's href so call the detail() by its name.

-If you want to change the URL of the polls detail view to something else,
perhaps to something like polls/specifics/12/ instead of doing it in the
template (or templates) you would change it in polls/urls.py:
...
# added the word 'specifics'
path('specifics/<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
...

5.4. Namespacing URL names and Why?
- We namespace URL names(paths urlpatterns) incase we had the same function
name in other app installed so the will not be confused on what function/URL
to access.
Before:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
]

After:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'polls'  # ADDED LINE
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
    path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
    path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
]

-Now change your polls/index.html template from:
polls/templates/polls/index.html

Before:
<li><a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>

to point at the namespaced detail view:
After:
<li><a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
